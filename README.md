## Development setup

Active development happens on VS-Code (since it's mainly javascript and HTML).

Useful extensions include:

- ESLint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
    + First install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
    + Run `npm install` at the top-level of your workspace
        + You want to run this in the "Node.js command prompt" instead of the regular windows one. Otherwise you'll get an error that npm isn't defined.
    + Restart the ESLint server
- Live Preview: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server

If you've got these set up, you should have linting support set up by default in-editor.
